    <div class="text-center"> <p class="text-white bg-dark">This is just a bullshit website I created and put countless hours in for no reason. Well there was a reason. Or a purpose rather. It's purpose was to get you to this page. So Mademoiselle Rishita Das, I bow down before you as you take your birthday crown. You're a jewel and evidently pretty invaluable in the lives of many people you've met. I don't speak for others when I say you're one of the best trait combinations a person could have. Definitely not. They don't find beauty in you in ways that I do that's foh sure. You've spinned my life in ways no one has and I do speak for others in this matter. 
Life is a blissful combination of sweet moments and you have been the cherry on top for me in those regards. I do not regret a single moment I spent with you and hold each one with the utmost fondness in my memory.
More on personal side of things, I'm genuinely sorry if I affected you negatively or hurt you throughout the span of last year. I don't kid when I say you're the only person among my peers that I value the opinions of. I hope we can get back to where we were but all I value today is that you still consider me a friend. Have a joyful day ahead rish.</p></div></body></html>
